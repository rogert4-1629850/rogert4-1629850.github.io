	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p> My name is Trevor Rogerson and I am a sophmore at UW pursuing Biology, with a focus in Evolutionary Biology. I love watching TV and going on runs and hikes in my free time. </p>
	<p> At home, football is the most important thing. My favorite team is the Detroit Lions, which is a sad experience because they can't win to save their lives. Despite that, I am always hopeful this will be our year! </p>
	<p> I always like to spread my horizons and trying new things even when I am not good at them. While I am not an expert at coding, it is a fun challenge. I can't wait to learn more in this class. </p>
